  <!-- ABOUT CONTENT -->
  <section class="section">
    <p>
      JollofSpotNG is a Nigerian food business focused on preparing well-seasoned
      jollof rice and local meals with attention to freshness, consistency, and
      presentation. Our meals are prepared with care to ensure every order meets
      the same standard of taste and quality.
    </p>

    <p>
      We serve individuals, group orders, and small events across multiple
      locations, including Lagos, Ibadan, and Ado-Ekiti. Whether it’s a single
      takeaway or a party tray, each order is handled with the same level of
      attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our approach is simple: cook fresh, portion properly, and deliver on time.
      This focus has helped us build trust with customers who return for both
      everyday meals and special occasions.
